## Overview

This is my solution for the FrontendMentor QR Code Component challenge.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

I have added a screenshot of my solution.

## My process
I looked at the sample from time to time, and tried to make my solution closely look like the sample.
I could not make use of the sample font family, so I used Arial.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### Continued development

Although, making use of CSS wasn't so challenging in this challenge, I still have to practice using it more.
